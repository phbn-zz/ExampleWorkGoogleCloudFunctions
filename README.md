# ExampleWorkGoogleCloudFunctions
NOTE: As Google Cloud Functions have made it possible to use Node 8 by April 1 2019, this code will all be refactored to Async/Await. Please forgive my use of multiple nested promises as a temporary workaround for not having access to the more readable code.

A demonstration of my coding with NodeJS and Firebase/Firestore, which creates an account in Firebase for a user of the ExampleApp (https://github.com/phbn/ExampleAppExpoReactNative-app). This is possible through a simple e-mail sign up, or signing in with LinkedIn, which I bootstrapped to enable my previous company to integrate their React Native app with LinkedIn. Furthermore, the code saves the LinkedIn users information to Firebase for later marketing purposes.
